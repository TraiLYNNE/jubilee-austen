        <p><span>Hi,</span> I'm a developer that loves clean &amp; elegant code.</p>

    <div id='about'>
        <div class='half-width'>
            <p>
                I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was
                hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class='half-width'>
            <p>
                That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development,
                where I can use my organizational skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.

            <h3>
                Hand-Coded HTML
            </h3>

            <p>
                My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.

            <h3>
                Well-Organized CSS
            </h3>

            <p>
                I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.

            <p>
                You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly &amp; accurately convert it into a webpage that is the pixel-perfect match.
